## Introduction

This Lab requires you to perform research over methods in the Psych library. See lab assignment for details.

## Learning

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features that GitHub provides.

Each of these guides will help you to understand how to use both [GitHub](http://github.com) and [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).

To do well on this assignment, you should review your notes and slides. Please see the course instructor if you have questions about any of these reading assignments.
